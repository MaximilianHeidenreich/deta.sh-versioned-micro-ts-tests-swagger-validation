## Abstract

Thsi repo is an opinionated template for building strong Deta.sh micros.
It provides a project structure & dev tools which can be used to quickly develop and deploy express applications. Of course, you can just use the Deta CLI and run all the different commands by yourself, but in case you want a streamlined experience (especially with typescript & different environments), this template might be for you.

It is mainly intendet for serving API's and provides the following featues:

-   [x] Typescript (Develop a strongly typed application)
-   [x] Tests using mocha & chai (Write unit tests for different components)
-   [ ] API Tests (Coming soon: Test your api)
-   [x] API Documentation using SwaggerUI (Access the SwaggerUI webinterface to view & try your api)
-   [x] API Validation (Ensure all requests and responses adhere to an OpenAPI specification)
-   [x] API Versioning (Run multiple endpoint versions at once to retain backwards compatability)
-   [x] Different environments (Change the behaviour of your api in different environments -> by default: `sandbox` & `production`)
-   [ ] CI/CD Pieline using github actions
-   [ ] Configurable includes (e.g. static files)
-   [x] Easy developer experience
    -   [x] Easily configure your micro and environments from `deta.json` file
    -   [x] Easily build & deploy changes using npm scripts
    -   [x] Start a local dev server

<br>

## Installation

1. [Install Deta CLI](https://docs.deta.sh/docs/cli/install) & [Authenitcate](https://docs.deta.sh/docs/cli/auth)
2. Clone this repository
3. Modify `deta.json` to configure the deployment
4. Run `npm run setup` (This will install dependencies and create micros / clone existing ones into `build/`)
5. Run `npm run dev:sandbox` to try out your micro locally
6. Run `npm run deploy` to deploy your environments to the cloud

<br>

## Project structure

> Files with the `?` suffix are not required!

> This example describes a layout for 2 configured environments: `sandbox` & `production`

```plain
build/
    sandbox/                - Build output for production environment
    production/             - Build output for production environment
src/                        - All source files of the application
    lib/                    - Utility files (e.g. math, token generation, authentication...)
        routes/
            v1/             - Dir containing router & all route files for v1 specification
                router.ts   - Defines express routes from route files
                index.ts    - Example route file for "/" (Will get mapped to http://xxx/v1/)
                spec.yaml?  - OpenAPI specification for v1 routes
            v2/             - Dir containing router & all route files for v2 specification
                ...
        increment.ts        - Example math function
    devServer.js            - Local dev server
    index.js                - Global (express) configuration
test/                       - Dir containing all tests
    increment.spec.ts       - Example test for increment file
.detaignore                 - Lists files which won't be uploaded to the micro (paths relative to environment build directory)
.production.env             - Environment values for production environment
.sandbox.env                - Environment values for sandbox environment
deta.json                   - Deployment configuration
```

<br>

## Usage

Acessing the `/` root endpoint will give you a json response containing the available api version endpoints like:

> // TODO: impl / fix

```json
{
	"v1": "https://detaURL/v1"
}
```

After installing & setup, you can create your express API routes as usual.
If you create a `spec.yaml` OpenAPI file inside a `routes/vX` directory, the project automatically adds request & response validation for enpoints which are documented inside `spec.yaml` and the following endpoints:

-   `https://xxx/v1/docs`: SwaggerUI API Docs & Explorer
-   `https://xxx/v1/spec.yaml`: The spec.yaml file
-   `https://xxx/v1/spec.json`: A transpiled spec.json file

If you want to create a new API version, just duplicate the previous `vX` directory and make your changes. The new route wil automatically be mounted as long as there is a valid `router.ts` (`router.js` after build) file inside the `vX` directory.

While developing you can either run `npm run dev` to test your application locally or `npm run deploy` to build and deploy your latest changes.

### deta.json configuration

The `deta.json` file contains the base configuration for the environment micros and the environments itself.

```json
{
	"micro_name": "exampleAPI", // The name (Will be suffixed with the environment e.g. example-api-sandbox)
	"deta_project": "MicroTSTemplate", // The project in which the micros should exist
	"environments": [
		// Each environment = 1 micro
		{
			"name": "sandbox",
			"auth": false, // Whether to enable/disable api authentication using a project key
			"confirmDeploy": false // Whether to require confirmation when deploying
		},
		{
			"name": "production",
			"auth": false,
			"confirmDeploy": true
		}
	]
}
```

### NPM Scripts

#### Core

##### npm run test

> Runs all tests inside `test/` using [mocha](https://mochajs.org) and [chai](https://www.chaijs.com).

##### npm run build:[environment]

> Builds all environments or the specified one.
> Build includes preparing by cleaning the build folders, typescript compilation, transpilation of `spec.yam` files to spec.json files and copying all necessary project files from `src/` to the build output directory.

##### npm run dev:<environment>

> Builds the specified environment and runs the `devServer.js` file inside that environments directory.

##### npm run deploy:[environment]

> Runs tests (must not fail!), builds the specified environment (empty for all), runs detaSetup and deploy tasks.
> If `confirmDeploy` is `true` in `deta.json` file, The user is prompted to confirm the deploy action.

#### Utility

##### npm run detaSetup

> Runs detaSetup task which creates new micros or clones existing ones from the configured project.

##### npm run setup

> Installs project dependencies for development, builds the project and calls npm run detaSetup.

##### npm run format:<check/write>

> Only checks or changes (writes) to all files inside `src/` & `test/` enforcing the `.prettierrc.json` specification.

<br>

### Gulp tasks

```plain
gulp detaSetup                      - Setups up deta micros (creating / cloning existing) inside environment folders.
gulp build [--env=<environment>]    - Builds all environments or the one specified.
gulp deploy [--env=<environment>]   - Deploys all environments or the one specified.
```
